Description: The phruta R package is designed to simplify the basic
            phylogenetic pipeline. Specifically, all code is run within
            the same program and data from intermediate steps are saved in
            independent folders. Furthrmore, all code is run within the
            same environment which increases the reproducibility of your analysis.
            phruta retrieves gene sequences, combines newly downloaded and local
            gene sequences, and performs sequence alignments.
